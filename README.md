This repository is a DNN-based ensemble singing voice synthesis library, based on [DNN-based ensemble singing voice synthesis with interactions between singers]([text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09988)). The implementation is based on [NNSVS]([text](https://github.com/nnsvs/nnsvs)) and has been modified to enable multi-track training.
